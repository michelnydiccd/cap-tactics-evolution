# Combat Air Patrol (CAP) Tactics Evolution Archive

## Mission
This repository serves as a living historical archive documenting the evolution of U.S. Air Force Combat Air Patrol (CAP) tactics from the Vietnam War through the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Created by a former U.S. Air Force pilot with combat experience in these theaters, this archive preserves hard‑won lessons and tactical innovations for future pilots, historians, and aviation enthusiasts.

## Project Purpose
- To provide a centralized, open‑source record of CAP doctrine, techniques, and real‑world adaptations across multiple decades of aerial warfare.
- To highlight the interplay between technology, rules of engagement, and pilot decision‑making in the CAP mission.
- To honor the sacrifices and ingenuity of the aircrew who developed and executed these tactics in defense of freedom and democracy.

## Eras Covered
1. **Vietnam War (1960s‑1970s)**
   - Early radar limitations and visual identification challenges.
   - Transition from gun‑based dogfights to early‑generation air‑to‑air missiles.
   - Rules of engagement (ROE) that shaped CAP operations over North Vietnam.
   - The emergence of dedicated CAP stations and tanker support.

2. **Gulf War / Desert Storm (1990‑1991)**
   - Integration of AWACS (E‑3 Sentry) for battle‑space management.
   - Advanced radar data‑linking and Non‑Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR).
   - Multi‑role fighter integration (F‑15, F‑16, F‑14) in a high‑threat environment.
   - The shift toward beyond‑visual‑range (BVR) engagements.

3. **Global War on Terror (Afghanistan & Iraq, 2001‑present)**
   - Coalition interoperability and combined‑force CAP.
   - CAP’s role in counter‑insurgency (COIN) and close air support (CAS) integration.
   - The impact of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on battlespace awareness.
   - Persistent CAP loiter and “overwatch” for ground forces.
